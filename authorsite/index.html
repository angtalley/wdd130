        AuthorsRealm is a site created by readers and writers for readers and writers. 
        Throughout years of taking writing and intensive literary 
        analysis courses, Angela, the mind behind Authors Realm, hasn’t found an online writing platform 
        that functions to create a platform that intrigues readers and writers alike, and hopes to conjoin the two together. 
        After all, a writer is a reader who just wants to read the story they’re creating. Join the journey as Angela researches 
        and writes.

            Every writer has a writer’s style and voice. Have you ever wondered what makes an author intriguing and 
            relevant? The Brave New World author Aldous Huxley said, “Words can be like X-rays if you use 
            them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.” We explore the 
            techniques of writers who have crafted words that became X-rays. We also discuss how to 
            replicate techniques in our own voices. </p>

        <p> “You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me,” 
            C.S. Lewis said. Well, what about five books, Lewis? Here, you can find writers of similar 
            genre or story so you know what to read next. You’ll never be left bored 
            or in a readers lag following this page. </p>

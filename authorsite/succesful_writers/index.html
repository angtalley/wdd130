                Stephen King. Rick Riordan. Shannon Messenger. 
                What do these names have in common? They are all modern writers. Every writer has a writer’s style and voice. 
                They explore challenges of the human heart and world through words. Have you ever wondered how these writers 
                became so popular? Why their writing is so intriguing and relevant? The Brave New World author Aldous Huxley 
                said, “Word can be like X-rays if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.” 
                We explore the techniques of writers who have crafted words that became X-rays, and examine why those techniques 
                are so powerful. We also discuss how to replicate a technique. Explore this page and leave a comment for an author 
                you would love to learn more about.

            <a href="">A Critique on Technique: Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl</a>
            <p>I remember running out of my bedroom with a beat-up slightly torn copy of Eragon. 
                I asked my mom, “what next?” and she walked me to the massive bookshelf that spanned 
                the entire living room wall. That is when I was introduced to Eoin Colfer’s Artemis Fowl. 
                I was entranced.</p>
                <p> The first book in the series achieves something not many books do—it is written as if 
                it were a camera lens focusing on the main character, Artemis Fowl. The first sentence, 
                “Ho Chi Minh City in the summer,” immediately places the reader on this zoom lens, where 
                Colfer takes the reader through the city, getting more and more narrow, until it lands on 
                Artemis with the simple sentence, “sun did not suit Artemis.” I adore the zoom/lens technique 
                because a well-executed setup reads just how a movie would unfold and can focus on something 
                small like Artemis’s two left feet, or something as grand and unfamiliar as Haven City, an 
                underground fantasy fairy city. </p>
            
       <p> The biggest technique Colfer has mastered is the use of simple to complex language and plot 
                that shift throughout the novels. The first book targets children around 10-12 years old, 
                however, the final book targets late teens/young adults. Colfer wrote a series that matures 
                with its audience. At the climax of the first novel, the big reveal is that Holly, an elf 
                LEPrecon (police officer), escaped Artemis’s cell. On average, sentences are made up of 
                simple words, and are about 6-10 words in length, for example, “Artemis glanced at the 
                landing cameras.” The fourth novel’s climax is about Opal, a pixie, who betrayed the rest 
                of Haven City (which never happened in history before), and Holly... </p>

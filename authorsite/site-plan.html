      <h3>Why Author's Realm?</h3>
      <p>
        AuthorsRealm is a site created by readers and writers for readers and writers. 
        The mind behind AuthorsRealm is pursuing a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies - Creative Writing 
        at Brigham Young University Idaho. Throughout the years of taking writing and intensive literary 
        analysis courses, Angela has incurred her list of questions and interests that she wants answers for. 
        Throughout her years pursuing writing, Angela hasn’t been able to find an online writing platform 
        that functions to create a platform that intrigues readers and writers alike, and hopes to conjoin the two together. 
        After all, a writer is a reader who just wants to read the story they’re creating. Join the journey as Angela researches 
        and even writes her own novels.

      <h3>Famous Writers in Work</h3>
      <p>
        Stephen King. Rick Riordan. Shannon Messenger. 
        What do these names have in common? They are all modern writers. Every writer has a writer’s style and voice. 
        They explore challenges of the human heart and world through words. Have you ever wondered how these writers 
        became so popular? Why their writing is so intriguing and relevant? The Brave New World author Aldous Huxley 
        said, “Word can be like X-rays if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.” 
        We explore the techniques of writers who have crafted words that became X-rays, and examine why those techniques 
        are so powerful. We also discuss how to replicate a technique. Explore this page and leave a comment for an author 
        you would love to learn more about.

      <h3>Writing Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        Wading through life as a writer is tough. There never seems to be enough feedback, enough editing, enough rereads. 
        It’s never perfect, it’s just better than what it was before. On this page we study what famous writers have said 
        about writing, explore our own writing advice, and offer encouragement to writers just trying their best. This page 
        also includes a column where you can explore jobs in the world of writing, along with information to submit your writing to publications. 
        Remember to commit about writing advice you would like to have featured or explored. And always remember the words of the writer of the Song of Solomon, 
        Toni Morrison. “If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.”

      <h3>Book Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        “You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me,” C.S. Lewis said. Well, what about five books, Lewis? Have you ever 
        been caught up in a novel, or world, and when it finishes, you’re left wondering what is next? Fear no longer! This page explores writers of similar 
        genres or story devices so you know what to read next. You’ll never be left bored or in a readers lag following this page. This page is created by readers, 
        for readers. Leave a comment for a novel we’ve yet to discuss to find out what paths your current reading trend will take you.

      <h3>Writing Buddies</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, this is a platform for aspiring writers to find writing buddies. Here, you can post your unpublished work and receive feedback from other writers. 
        If you post, be sure to give feedback to at least one other person, because we all know what it feels like to see others get feedback but not yourself. 
        If you expect others to review, be sure to review others. Even high-fantasy greats like C.S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien needed each other to strengthen their writing.

    <h2> Angela Larson (Talley)</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! I got married a little over a month ago now, 
        so that's pretty much my personality right now! 
        I'm enjoying my newly-wed life right now with my 
        husband, Tanner. We were married in Star Valley, 
        Wyoming and it was a ton of fun!</p>
    <p> My degree is Interdisciplinary Studies with an emphasis
        in creative writing, a minor in journalism, and a certificate
        in web frontend design! I hope to be an online content writer/editor. 
        In my free time, I like to hike, watch LOTR, or draw. Tanner and
        I have found a big passion in making food together! </p>
